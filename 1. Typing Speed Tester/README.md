# ‚å®Ô∏è Typing Speed Tester in Python

A simple command-line Python program to test your typing speed and accuracy.

## Features

- Measures typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
- Calculates typing accuracy as a percentage.
- Uses a fixed sentence for testing: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
- Allows multiple tests in a single session.
- Handles invalid menu inputs gracefully.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file.
2. Run the program with Python 3. For example:
   ```bash
   python typing_test.py
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to start the typing test and view your results.

## Example

```
============================================================
Typing Speed Tester
1. Start Typing Test
2. Exit
============================================================
Enter your choice: 1

============================================================
Type the following sentence as fast as you can:

"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
============================================================

Press Enter when you are ready to start...

Start typing here: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

============================================================
Typing Test Results
------------------------------------------------------------
Time taken       : 5.23 seconds
Typing speed     : 51.37 words per minute
Accuracy         : 100.00%
============================================================
```

## How the Program Works

- You are given a fixed sentence to type.
- Timing starts when you begin typing and stops when you finish.
- Words per minute (WPM) is calculated using the total words typed divided by time taken.
- Accuracy is calculated by comparing your typed words to the original sentence.
- The computer choice is randomly generated each round.
